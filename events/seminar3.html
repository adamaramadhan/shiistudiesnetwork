                    <h2>“Who Will Buy from Me My Umm Walad?”: A Ḥadīth-Based Study On Imāmī Traditions On The Status Of <i></i>Umm Walad</i></h2>
                    <p>This study investigates the legal and social construction of the <i>umm walad</i> within early Imāmī Shīʿī ḥadīth literature, challenging prevailing scholarly narratives that reduce the Shiʿi–Sunni divergence on this issue to a simple opposition between ʿUmar’s prohibition of selling <i>ummhāt al-awlād</i> and ʿAlī’s alleged later permissiveness. Through a close reading of the earliest Imāmī sources, including the four canonical ḥadīth collections and pre-canonical works such as <i>Qurb al-Isnād</i>, this study argues that the formative Shiʿi tradition preserves a far more nuanced and internally diverse discourse than is often acknowledged. In these texts, early Imams articulate definitions of <i>umm walad</i> that extend beyond childbirth to encompass pregnancy, miscarriage, and the broader integration of enslaved women into the intimate sphere of the household. Several early reports attributed to al-Bāqir and al-Ṣādiq link both <i>istīlād</i> and manumission not to the survival of the child but to the fact of conception itself, suggesting that emancipation could occur even in cases of miscarriage. These early positions contrast with later juristic attempts to reconcile the ḥadīths with evolving legal norms that tied manumission to the master’s death and the child’s inheritance share.</p>
                    
                    <p>Examining testamentary documents attributed to ʿAlī and al-Kāẓim, the study shows that early Imāmī thought distinguished among multiple categories of enslaved women, granting specific legal rights—including marriageability and emancipation—to <i>ummhāt al-awlād</i> even when their children had died. The paper further reassesses the oft-cited claim that ʿAlī permitted the sale of <i>ummhāt al-awlād</i>, arguing that the relevant Imāmī reports present these sales as exceptional measures undertaken to redeem the women from outstanding debts, rather than as evidence of a general permissibility.</p>

                    <h3>Zahra Azhar</h3>
                    <p><strong>PhD Candidate</strong><br>
                    Universiteit Leiden</p>
                    
                    <p>Zahra is a PhD candidate at the Leiden Institute for Area Studies, where she researches the social and intellectual history of early Twelver Shiʿism as part of the project Embodied Imamate: Mapping the Development of the Early Shiʿi Community, 700–900 CE. Her dissertation specifically investigates the role of concubine mothers of the Imams, examining how these women influenced issues of legitimacy within the Shiʿi community. Just as key family figures can shape a dynasty’s future, Zahra's work looks at how these mothers impacted the authority and acceptance of the Imams. She is very interested in understanding the dynamics of power, slavery, and gender in the history of the early Shia community.</p>
