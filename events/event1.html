                    <h2>Abstract</h2>
                    <p>This presentation explores the dynamic relationship between traditional Shii jurisprudence (fiqh) and contemporary legal and social challenges. Drawing from both classical sources and modern scholarly discourse, we examine how Shii jurists have adapted age-old legal principles to address current issues such as medical ethics, environmental concerns, and social justice.</p>
                    
                    <p>The discussion will focus on key methodological approaches employed by contemporary Shii scholars, including the role of reason (aql) in legal reasoning, the application of general principles (qawa'id), and the concept of changing circumstances (taghayyur al-ahwal). We will analyze specific case studies that demonstrate how these methodological tools have been utilized to derive legal opinions on modern issues.</p>
                    
                    <p>Furthermore, this presentation will examine the institutional frameworks within which contemporary Shii jurisprudence operates, including the role of religious authorities (maraji') and the process of legal consultation (istifta'). The discussion will conclude with an analysis of future challenges and opportunities for Shii jurisprudence in an increasingly globalized world.</p>
                    
                    <p>This event is particularly relevant for graduate students interested in Islamic law, contemporary religious thought, and the intersection of tradition and modernity in Islamic scholarship.</p>
